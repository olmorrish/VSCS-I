FT: Dec 18, 1996||	Picked up one of those old VSCS-I machines at a garage sale the other day, just for kicks. Monica also thought it was pretty neat; she loves anything retro-futuristic. Honestly they should make one of those PC games with that theme. |	This thing is SUPER bulky - not like the IBM stuff I use at work. The fan honestly never stops and the drive is constantly spinning... not sure why though. I'm no engineer, but it seems pretty inefficient.

No wonder it sold so poorly. "VSCS" is pretty funny name for this thing in hindsight, but I guess it was one of the first consumer machines to do the whole "user" thing.|	There doesn't seem to be a way to change passwords or delete users either which seems... stupid?||	Honestly the more I read, the more I'm convinced that this thing was designed in like, a month. Two, tops.

FT: Jan 8, 1997||	Seems like the tech gods have answered my prayers. The parent company of VSCS is still kicking around, and they released a drive that uses some fancy new "SHA hashing" for the passwords for its 20th anniversary. They were actually off by a couple years, so it's not 20 years though?? Odd people, doesn't matter. |	I'm probably the only one who bought the thing, anyways - why release a security update for a machine that was released before security updates were a thing????. ||	Anyways, I'm gonna see if I can get it to work. It takes an insane number of cables to update the thing, but I'm still off work for another week so it'll give me something to do.

FT: Jan 12, 1997||	I've changed the way the machine stores passwords to check if they're correct. Now, it'll store them in a text file in my directory, and they should be barely human-readable.|| It's called "sexadecimal" I think, just numbers an ABCDEF. The computer should store "hashes" of our passwords - it can shash them when we enter them to check if they're right, BUT it can't reverse the hashes to get the passwords back. Pretty clever||	I don't think anyone could find the password unless there was some database on the Web to search. Not like anything like that would be possible - how would anybody find it? Not like you can just plug in a "hash" and get the password from a database.

She definitely doesn't care about the security stuff at all, though I'm mostly just mad because of the name. ||	Seriously though...||VERY|SECURE|COMPUTER|SYSTEM|| No wonder there wasn't a Mark II, haha.

FT:		Well Shaun wasn't kidding - this thing is preeeetty thrown together. I've already created a folder I can't delete and it's been about... 2 minutes?|	If Shaun's files are anything to go by, every single text document on this thing is going to just be a breakdown of why it sucks.||	Looks pretty damn cool though. That green glowing text? Chilling. It's like what someone in the 50's would think 90's computers would be like. It'd be nice if this ol' hunk of junk didn't just collect dust. It's really charming.

FT:		My little brother Jake visited Shaun and I today; surprisingly he agreed with me - he thinks the VSCS is cool as heck too.|	But boy does that 14-year age gap show sometimes though... he's more interested in making weird art to display on the terminal and stuff. I let him set up an account on the machine and he named himself after some rap artist instead of using his real name.|	I don't really get the fun in that, but whatever makes him happy is fine by me.

FT:		I've been sending Jake home with the VSCS on the weekends, as long as he promises to bring it back I have to trouble with that. I don't really feel like journaling on this thing, even if I dig the ~aesthetic~ of that. This thing's more of a conversation piece, so if it makes Jake happy, that's cool with me.|	Not really sure how mom puts up with him and the rap music these days though. He won't stop writing "$$$" on everything. Dollar signs everywhere, like he's worshipping capitalism. Apparently it's a rap somg?|| How do you even pronounce "$$$"? You can't.|| Weird kid, gotta love him.
