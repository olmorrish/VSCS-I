FT: The VSCS-I (Very Secure Computer System - Mark I) is designed to make your life easier than ever.|	At <VAR MISSING:)@;b3,7-> we're dedicated to pushing the bar for technology, and that's why your display has not just one screen, but TWO. The right-hand monitor is the FILE VIEWER. It is designed to display text (like this) at a higher resolution for easy-reading. With the VSCS's large hard-drive, this makes the machine perfect for authors and casual diary-keepers.

FT: As you have likely discovered, navigation feedback is given by the left screen, the NAVIGATION TERMINAL. Here are the most basic commands you may require to continue:||"HELP" will bring up a menu of the most important commands, without you having to reopen the manual.|"GOTO X" will open any file or directory named "X".|"OPEN X" will do the same thing as GOTO.|"BACK" will return you to the parent directory.|"LIST" will display all files in your current directory.|"LOST" will remind you of your current location in the file system.||If you are ever confused, remember, tell us you're LOST and ask for HELP! Alternatively, consult the manual here, or refer to documentation outside of the computer system.

FT: 	It might be too late.|	If you've purchased this computer, it's probably a relic now, but I need your help. I'm writing this in the year 1977. This message won't appear in the files of the default profile for another 25 years (give or take a few if the system clock is off). This was the only way I could hide this information without them finding out I was leaking it. Chances are, if you're reading this, they've probably already killed me.|	There's too much data to display it all here. Know this: the VSCS-I is DEEPLY FLAWED. If you're smart, you can piece everything together. My documents will be scattered everywhere. Aside from this file, I don't know where in the system they'll turn up. It'll be worse if this thing's been around for a while - there might be a few user profiles.|	If you're not one of them, I'm begging you, keep digging. It'll all become clear. Please.|| - M
