FT: 	The VSCS-I (Very Secure Computer System - Mark I) is designed to make your life easier than ever.|	At Stultusoft we pride ourselves on pushing the bar for technology, and that's why your display has not just one screen, but TWO. The right-hand monitor is the FILE VIEWER. It is designed to display text (like this) at a higher resolution for easy-reading.|	With the VSCS's large hard-drive, this makes the machine perfect for authors and casual diary-keepers!

FT: 	As you have likely discovered, navigation feedback is given by the left screen, the NAVIGATION TERMINAL. Here are the most basic commands you may require to continue:||"HELP" will bring up a menu of the most important commands, without you having to reopen the manual.|"OPEN X" will open any file or directory named "X".|"OPEN X Y" will unlock file or directory "X" with password "Y". |"GOTO X" will do the same thing as GOTO.|"BACK" will return you to the parent directory.|"LIST" will display all files in your current directory.|"LOST" will remind you of your current location in the file system.||	If you are ever confused, remember, tell us you're LOST and ask for HELP! Alternatively, consult the manual here, or refer to documentation outside of the computer system.

FT: 	Some files on the system may be locked, indicated by the "#" symbol. These users and files require a case-sensitive password to unlock.|	Unlocked files will remain unlocked for the remainder of the session. ||	Some files on the system may also be restricted to certain users. A file that you have permission to view will be preceeded by the "R" symbol.|	If you do not have read permission for a file, you will also not be permitted to unlock it until you have logged in as that file's owner.||	Read-permissions can be bypassed by users with MEGA privileges for the session -  be sure to lock MEGA.EXE if you are the owner of this system!||EXAMPLES: |	[R,_] means you have permission to read the file, and it is unlocked.|	[_,#] means the file is password locked, and you may not attempt to unlock it without logging in as the file owner.
