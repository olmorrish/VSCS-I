FT: Alice's Diary - June 23rd, 1966||	Today my parents bought the VSCS-I personal home computer system, which they say is super advanced. I think it's SOOOOOO GREAT. I will use it to keep a diary... and stuff. |	Okay, bye

FT: Alice's Diary - June 26th, 1966||	Dear Diary, |	Today, my bosses asked me to write up ANOTHER diary entry for the fictional little girl who uses the VSCS-I. I was SOOOOO HAPPY.|	Honestly though, why doesn't John just get his OWN daughter to write these things instead of me? Oh right, because the UI for this stupid thing is too complicated for a child. Like a kid would ever keep a diary on this thing. What a joke. |	Whatever, it's not like John's gonna read this anyways. I could put whatever I want in these placeholders, he won't check.

FT: 	Hope you're having fun reading those diary entries - they get surprisingly entertaining, in my opinion. Employees are only fun when they're disgruntled.|	So you've purchased this old computer. It's a relic now for sure - it was when I bought it as well. I've had a bit of fun with it, though. The VSCS-I is HILARIOUSLY flawed - almost anyone schmuck can crack it. If you're smart, you can piece together the password to my account, where I've hidden some valuable information. Trust me, it's worth it.|	I've scattered four pieces of my password across all the old users as a puzzle for the next owner of this fine machine. All you have to do is be resourceful: concatenate all the pieces together, and you can get access to my account and everything it holds.|	Have fun.||	- Rick||PS: The first fragment is: HAND

FT: Alice's Diary - July 2nd, 1966||	DEAR DIARYYYYY, |	Well, John's not renewing my contract anymore, so I guess I'm burning this system down with me. I hope he enjoys having his pathetic excuse for encryption explained to every user of his system. |	The VSCS is completely busted. The Alice profile stores all the passwords for the system to check against, and anyone can read them. Now get this: the system "encrypts" user passwords under a Caesar cipher. A CAESAR CIPHER. It's so weak it's embarassing. It just takes the list: |	  "abc...xyzABC...XYZ1234567890"|	and it stores every character of the password as the character that's three to the left of it in the list.|	So, future product-owner, all anyone has to do to access ANY PROFILE on  your machine is to look at any password in that file, then shift every character THREE TO THE LEFT in the list. Then BAM, that's the raw password.|	That's what John gets for not only using a shift cipher, but also using the same key every single time. Hilarious.

FT: Alice's Diary - July whocares-th, 19-sixty-blegh||	So like, if the password was "HeLL0", right? Then it'd be stored in the system as "KhOOc" -  you just shift each letter down three times. So "y" becomes "B". The zero at the end of "HeLL0" is kinda weird since it turns into a "c" - the list loops if you hit the end.|	Just remember that it's all the lowercase letters in order, then the uppercase letters, then the numbers 1-9 and then 0.|	"abc...xyzABC...XYZ1234567890"||	So congrats, now you're an amateur cryptographer, lucky you. Though it's not like anyone WITH A BRAIN has actually encrypted anything like this for the past thousand years and expected it to stay secret. I told him it was stupid, but did he listen?|	NoooooOOOOooooo

You should probably move that one or password lock it somewhere though. John made it default to Alice's directory, but if you're smart you'll move it.||	Y'know, because otherwise it'll GRANT EVERY USER MEGA PRIVILEGES.
