FT: i've been messing around with this computer Monica lent me. i managed to mess it up PRETTY nicely.||	This thing is honestly kinda c00l. I got access on the MEGA exe thingy because some d1ngus left notes about how his old boss just left it lying around. Alice had it but didnt use a password. Hid it in Shauns foldr. Locked it with the usual password.|	As long as nobody can get a hold of it, I'm basically the owner of this computer now. I'm like cybergod. ||r@d

FT: 	A word of warning: you might want to make sure you get MEGA privileges before you use that password of mine. It shouldn't be too hard.|	Remember: the weakest link in a security system is always the user.||The fourth and final fragment is: DOOR||	- Rick
